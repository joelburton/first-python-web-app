First Web App In Python
=======================

1. You'll need to install Python 3; you can do this anyway you know how
   (Homebrew, MacPorts, Linux apt-get, etc; you can also find this & get help
   by visiting http://python.org/)

2. Make a folder for our project

3. In the terminal, go into that folder and type:

    python3 -m venv venv

       ("make me a virtual environment called 'venv'")

    source venv/bin/activate
     
       ("use that venv virtual environment")

    pip install flask

        ("install the Flask library")

4. Then, you should be able to start the server by typing "flask run" in the terminal
   (control-C will quit that when you're done)

5. To see the site, visit http://localhost:5000/


Good luck!
